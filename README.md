# What have I used for this project?
This project needs 4 things:
  - Arduino UNO R3 ATmega328P ATMEGA16U2 Board
  - Microphone Sensor AVR PIC High Sensitivity Sound Detection Module For Arduino
  - Keyestudio 1Pc 40 RGB LED WS2812 Pixel Matrix Driver Board for Arduino SZ
  - USB cable that will come with Arduino board
 You can find all of these on eBay.
 
 # Notice!
 You will need to download https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XrXVZWfeDJ3LEzdauq8oFsSwcXSkRVRu/view and add everything inside to:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\libraries\Adafruit_NeoPixel path on your PC, so library can work from the audio visualizer code.
